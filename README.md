# Summer-of-Coding

Summer of Coding is a self-started, Angular based portfolio piece that presents the summer-long challenge to build a new web app every week. The goal of this project is to reinforce prior experience with Angular, build multiple, dynamic user interfaces representative of what can be found in the industry, and create a robust fountation for a productivity suite that could be built upon in the future.
